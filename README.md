# United-for-Relief
"United for Relief" is a website that aims to bring attention to the recent earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria. We have created a platform where individuals can make a difference by educating themselves on the earthquake and providing donations to trusted organizations. Our website features a landing page that highlights the severity of the situation, a "How you can Help" page with links to reliable organizations, a "Hear Their Stories" page that brings to light the heart-wrenching experiences of those affected, and a "Contact Us" page for any inquiries. Join us in our mission to make a positive impact on the lives of those affected by the earthquakes. Together, we can make a difference.
