    Imagine being jolted awake in the middle of the night by the violent shaking of your home, hearing the sound of buildings collapsing around you, realizing you've lost loved ones, friends, schoolmates, teachers, and the city you've known your whole life is now in ruins. This was the reality for many in south-eastern Turkey and Syria on Monday, February 6, 2023, when two devastating earthquakes with magnitudes of 7.8 and 7.5, struck the southeast of the country near the Syrian border. The first quake hit near the city of Gaziantep, followed by another quake in the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras province just hours later. The earthquakes took the lives of over 28,000 innocent people, leaving behind countless others to grieve their loss. To make matters even worse, people estimate that more than 100,000 people could still be buried under the rubble of their homes. Over 40 aftershocks have occurred since the first quake, causing even more fear and uncertainty for the affected communities. This is a tragedy that has left a profound impact on the people of Turkey and will be remembered for years to come.</p>
